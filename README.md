As one of my main interests in life, I've run with the travel theme.  My idea was to produce a
product which allows you to track countries which you have visited and also include a note.  The note could be a simple bit of advice, restaurant you liked, time to visit, blog, anything.  It also includes an inerative map which allows the user to click on the country, telling them its name.

For the client I used JavaScript/jquery and made AJAX calls to the API.  I also used an npm plugin
for the interactive map.  This was installed using command ```npm install datamaps```.
